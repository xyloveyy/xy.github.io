# 1. Intro to data science

## 1. Definition of data science
- Data science != machine learning
![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/11/sp8ZXjfQlT1Dvun.png)
- Def: The scientific process of extracting value from data

## 2. What do data scientists do

    - Data Science & Ethics
    - Version Control & Programming
    - Data & Data Wrangling
    - Data Visualization & Communication
    - Approaches to Data Analysis
- Exams:
    - Mon Oct 21st - “What is Data Science” through “Data Wrangling”

# 2. Ethics

## 1. About Reading1
- What points were made that you had not previously considered?
- What points do you agree with? With which do you disagree?
- What do you not understand? (Ask questions about these in section!)
- What points/topics do you think are missing?
- Does anything differ with what you’ve learned in other classes? Other papers/books?
- What ideas did this reading give you? What do you want to go learn more about?

# 3. Data science questions

## 1. Data science process
- ask an instreresting question
- get the data
- explore the data
- model the data
- communicate and visualize the results

## 2. Question
- Be specific
- Be answerable with data
- Specify what’s being measured

# 4. Reproducibility
## 1. Definition of reproducibility
Re-performing the same analysis (with the same code) using a different analyst

## 2. Why haven’t we always been reproducible?
- Data science education and effective communication can improve these!
  - Lack of statistical literacy
  - Lack of computational literacy
- These can largely be addressed with fairly simple changes!
  - Failure to publish code
  - Lack of mechanism for peer-reviewing code
  - Lack of transparency in review of papers
- Others
  - Lack of incentive / funds

## 3. Definition of Replicable
Re-performing the experiment and collecting new data

Replicability is harder than reproducibility(Because the data is different & data is variable)

Defin: The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team using
the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same
operating conditions, in the same or a different location on multiple trials.

## 4. Why would a study fail to replicate?
- Finding was not “real” (or small effect)
- Measurement error
- Variable finding (i.e. time)
- Different population
- Different experimental design or conditions

## 5. Confirmation Bias
A cognitive bias wherein humans have a tendency to search for, interpret,
favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting
beliefs or hypotheses.

# 5. Programming
## 1. workflow => Think-Try-Read
1. Think about what it is you want to do.
2. Try it out.
    1. If you succeed, awesome.
    2. If not, continue on...
3. Read to try to figure out the answer (Google/Stack Overflow/books/your friend/etc.).
4. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.

# 6. File management 
## 1. Version Control
A way to manage the evolution of a set of files
- Enables multiple people to simultaneously work on a single project.
- Each person edits their own copy of the files and chooses when to share those
changes with the rest of the team.
- Thus, temporary or partial edits by one person do not interfere with another
person's work

## 2. File name
- Machine readable
- Human readable
- Nicely ordered

# 7. Data
## 1. Variable Types
- Quantitative
  - Integers (whole numbers, i.e. 10)
  - Continuous: Float or Numeric (200.78)
- Qualitative
  - String or Character (“Hello World”)
  - Categorical or Discrete (limited number of options) - (i.e. minor, adult)

## 2. categorize data storage
- Semi-structured*
  - spreadsheets (tabular data)
  - JSON & XML
- Structured
  - relational databases (SQL)
- Unstructured
  - everything else: video, audio, images, websites, apps, text, etc.

Data Scientists work with semi-structured data most frequently, but have to familiar with and comfortable in all types

# 8. Getting data
## 1. Where
1. All in nice spreadsheet
- Open data
  - www.kaggle.com
  - data.world
  ...

2. Not in nice spreadsheet
- HTTP(If there's API)
- WEB SCRAPING(If there's not API)

Use API
Accessing an API
1. Choose Method
2. Build URL
3. Get Authorization

# 9. Data wrangling
## 1. Tidy Data Benefits
1. consistent data structure
2. foster tool development
3. require only a small set of tools to be learned
4. allow for datasets to be combined

![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/21/EyoP6l2RSe7TYhq.png)

## 2. steps
- Step 1: Join columns from separate tables by ID
- Step 2: Select columns from
separate tables you want
included in your output
- Step 3: Arrange rows to order
by series and then by episode
- Step 4: Mutate & Summarize
to add columns

# 10. Data visualization

## 1. Information about a single set of numbers
1. Histograms: Range of possible height values is easily visualized
2. Densityplot: Demonstrates the distribution of the data (A smoothed version of a histogram)

## 2. Relationship between two numerical variables
1. Scatteplot

## 3. Count of values within a categorical variable
1. Barplot: Can easily see that there are more females than males

## 4. Summary of numerical values across categories
1. Boxplot: The middle line represents the median & tells you the typical height for females and males

## 5. Effective ways to display data summaries
1. Table: Tables count as data visualizations!

# 11. Descriptive Data Analysis
## 1. Descriptive:
The goal of descriptive analysis is to understand the components of a data set, describe
what they are, and explain that description to others who might want to understand the data.

## 2. sampling & statistics
- Statistics: the science that deals with the **collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of numerical facts or data**, and that, by use of mathematical theories of probability, imposes order and regularity on aggregates of more or less disparate elements.
- sampling: need to be random and no-bias

## 3. How to describe a dataset
- Shape: It’s critical to know the distribution of the variables in your dataset because certain statistical approaches can only be used with certain distributions.
- Size
- Central Tendency
- Missingness: It’s critical to know how many observations have missing data for variables of interest in your data.
- Variability

## 4. Outlier
- Data entry errors
- Poor sampling procedures
- Technical or mechanical error
- Unexpected changes in weather
- People providing inaccurate information

Caution: Observations should only be removed from your dataset if you have a valid reason to do so.

## 5. mean, median, and/or mode
The mode is the most frequently observed category
- Range: highest score - lowest score
- Interquartile Range (IQR): 75th percentile - 25th percentile
- variance: measures how close the values in the distribution are to the middle of the distribution - average squared difference of the scores from the mean
- standard deviation (SD): square-root of the variance

# 12 EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
Answers the question “What can the data tell us?”

## 1. EDA Approaches to “Get a Feel for the Data”
![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/10/25/59Dhwu7nUyzPYeI.png)

## 2. When NOT to do EDA
- To identify samples that you can remove from your study after you’ve already analyzed the data
- After running a statistical test and seeing that your p-value is 0.054
- After completing an analysis and getting an answer you don’t like
- To improve the correlation between two variables


# 13 Data visualization(Visualization for Communication)

## 1. why data communication matters
1. it's often the only thing your boss see
2. it can set your work from others
3. it helps show off the awesome stuff you have done
4. cognitive load is a thing

## 2. Exploratory vs. Explanatory
Creating good visualization is a process

![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/07/hXaOzTBkeMR6sPl.png)

## 3. Creating visuals for communication(aka explanation data visualizations)
1. What's your point?
<br>headline
2. How can you emphasize yout point in your chart
<br>chart type, data, color, highlights, annotations
3. What does the final chart show exactly
<br>description, legends/keys, source

## 4. COloe consideration
- Gradients are for continuous values. Distinct colors are for categories
- Color consistency helps viewers.
- Gray is your friend.
- Choose intuitive colors

## 5. less is more (Effective Visualization For Communication)
**Your communication should tell a story**
- A beginning
    - provide context
    - tell your audience what you're going to tell them
- A middle
    - show them
    - tell them
- An end

**Repetition is ok. You may be familiar with your topic, but your audience is not**

## 6. Presentation
1. when presentation out loud 
    - don't read directly off the slides
    - use animation to build your story
    - you benefit from having words to explain out loud what you're showing 

2. when presentation on paper
    - you can put more on a single visualization
    - you benefit from people having time to look at what you've sent

# 14 Analytical Approaches
![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/07/Sn47tpdVuElxDvP.png)


# 15 Inferential Analysis
## 1. approaches of inference 
- correltation: ASSOCIATION BETWEEN VARIABLES
<br> Pearson's r: linear correlation between two variables (takes values [-1,1])
<br> **Correlation establishes a relationship. It does NOT establish causation.**

- comparison of means: DIFFERENCE IN MEANS BETWEEN VARIABLES
<br> t-test:tests for difference in means between groups. 
<br> t-test Assumptions
    - Data are continuous
    - Normally distributed
    - Large enough sample size
    - Equal variance b/w groups
<br>p-value : the probability of getting the observed results (or results more extreme) by chance alone
- regression: DOES CHANGE IN ONE VARIABLE MEAN CHANGE IN ANOTHER?
    - Effect size (β) can
be estimated using
the slope of the line
- non-paramatric tests: FOR WHEN ASSUMPTIONS IN THESE OTHER 3 CATEGORIES ARE NOT MET

## 2. Confounding
Ignoring confounders will lead you to draw incorrect conclusions from your analyses
<br>You can plan ahead to avoid confounding and/or include confounders in your models to account    for their role on the outcome variable.

# 16. A/B testing
- **A/B Testing** : Designing and
running an experiment to
compare two versions
(typically, a web page or an
app), to determine which is
"better"
- Guidline for A/B:
    - Choose one key metric for testing
    - Design Experiment & Run for Length of Time Planned
    - Confidence Intervals more important than p-values
    - Don’t look at all the possible subgroups  
    - Look for “bucketing skew”
    - Only include meaningful users in your sample
    - Keep the analytical approach simple
    - Change one thing at a time

# 17. machine learning I
- predictive analysis uses data
you have now to make
predictions in the future
- machine learning
approaches are used for
predictive analysis!

## 1. Machine Learning Generalizations
- Basic Steps to Prediction
    - data partitioning
    - feature selection
    - model selection
    - model assessment


# 18. machine learning II
- unsupervise learning
- deep learning

# 19. Algorithms & Computability
- definition of algorithm: A finite set of rules that, if followed precisely, defines a sequence of operations that solves the problem in a finite number of steps.
## 1. Algorithms Tour
- Warehouse
Assignment
- Recommendation
Systems
- Matchmaking
- Human
Computation
- Logistics
Optimization


## 2. Algorithmic Considerations
algorithm should be designed to 
- solve a problem
    - efficient
    - as simple as possible 
    - correctly & ethically
- be adapted
    - by humans or systems

algorithms should be **FAT**:
- Fair
- Accountable
- Transparent



# 20 Text Analysis
- Approaches To: Text Analysis
    1. Sentiment Analysis
    2. TF-IDF
    3. Visualizations - Word Clouds & Networks
    4. much more!

## 1. Sentiment analysis
Programmatically infer emotional content of text:
- Break down into a individual or combination of words
- compare to a sentiment lexicon : dataset containing words classified by their sentiment

- token:  
    - what you use for analysis
    - tokenization takes corpus of text and splits it into tokens

- stop words
    - extremely common words such as “the”, “of”, “to”
    - are typically removed from analysis

## 2. TF-IDF(Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Term Frequency (TF)** : how frequently a word occurs in a document
- **Inverse document frequency (IDF)** : intended to measure how important a word is to a document

![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2019/11/19/jgAPwyG4LfkVvNc.png)

## 3. Visualize Narratives - Word Clouds & Networks


# 21. Geospatial Analysis
## 1. Why Geospatial Analysis?
- Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things
- to examine relationships between geographic features collectively and to use the  elationships to describe the real-world phenomena that map features represent

## 2. Visualizing Geospatial Data
- Use light colors for low values. Dark colors for high values.
- Choropleth Maps shine when displaying a single variable
- Choropleth excel at displaying the big picture, not subtle differences
- Choropleth should display relative differences, not absolute numbers
- Consider using the smallest unit possible(but there are exceptions)

## 3. Visualization Choices
- Cartograms should be considered when displaying how many people were affected

## 4. Spatial Statistics
- Violations of conventional statistics:
    - Spatial autocorrelation:
    - Modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP): 
    <br>The aggregation units used are arbitrary with respect to the phenomena under investigation, yet the aggregation units used will affect statistics determined on the basis of data reported in this way.
    <br>If the spatial units in a particular study were specified differently, we might
    observe very different patterns and relationships.

    - Edge effects (Boundary problem): Analyzing A vs B ignores similarities between the wo based on their shared boundary
    - Ecology fallacy: The Ecological Fallacy is a situation that can occur when a researcher or analyst makes an inference about an individual based on aggregate data for a group.(results from aggregated data (e.g. counties) cannot be applied to individual people)
    - Nonuniformity of space: Area with high crime rate is because the banks are clustered there.

causes (or cures)? - What is a choropleth map? 
- In what ways do spatial data violate conventional statistics? 
- What is spatial autocorrelation, and in what way are many real-world 
geospatial features highly spatially autocorrelated? 
- The modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) is important for things such as 
Gerrymandering: how we divide features across space influences 
aggregate statistics within those subdivisions! Be sure you understand this.
