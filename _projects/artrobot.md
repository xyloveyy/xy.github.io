This project is funded by National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students and won 1st Prize in the NXP Cup National University Students Intelligent Car Race. We adopted max gap to implement reactive motion planning approaches, and compared it with traditional navigation stacks. The speed of robot can reach nearly 4.0 m/s under the complex environment.
