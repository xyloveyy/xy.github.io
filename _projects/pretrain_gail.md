This is a GaTech course research project that proposes a flexible framework for studying GAIL's initialization. Here's the project paper link: [Initialization Study of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://yy-gx.github.io/assets/pdf/CS_7649___Final.pdf).


# Abstract 
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is an approach of imitation learning that uses demonstration data by experts and learns the unknown environmentâ€™s policy directly from data. One of its drawbacks is that it is unstable and difficult to train, so we propose a flexible framework for studying GAIL's initialization. We design 3 experiments and show that certain instantiations of our framework yields significant improvement gains. We have also provided several conclusions that are valuable for practical GAIL training.
